proj-samynjonas created by GitHub Classroom

This project uses the [https://sky.shiiyu.moe/api#tag/profile] api which is build on the [https://api.hypixel.net/#tag/API](official hypixel api).

With the api a player can search up any player via its minecraft username and the application will return some ingame stats if the player has these.

The usage of the application is fairly easy, when you start up the project you get greated with this screen...

Here you can see the stats, you can switch between the pets - stats or quests
Most Hypixel player use different profiles to play those are those fruit names you see on the right, press on them to switch between them.

If you want to search another player simply press "Go back" on the top of your screen and you will be back at the search screen.
